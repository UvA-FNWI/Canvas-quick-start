        A number of application-level tools in Canvas, which are found in the leftmost red sidebar, are useful to be familiar with. 

        <div class="block">
            <h2>Dashboard</h2>

            <div>
                <p>
                    On the <em>Dashboard</em> you see all active courses. Here you can also find the Canvas support course of the FNWI. 
                    Students also get an overview of approaching deadlines and pending assignments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under <em>Courses</em> you can find all courses that you can access. Using the star option, you can edit which courses are visible on the dashboard.

        <div class="block">
            <h2>Notifications</h2>
            <img src="https://content.datanose.nl/canvas/notifications.png" />
            <div>
                <p>
                    Under <em>Account</em> you can change your personal settings. 
                    Here you can also configure whether and how often you receive e-mail <em>Notifications</em> from Canvas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: students can also configure these notifications, so it may differ per student how quickly they are informed about 
                    announcements or changes in a Canvas course. To e-mail all studens directly you can use the DataNose e-mail option.
                </p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    The <em>Inbox</em> is a messaging system within Canvas. It allows you to send messages to (groups of) students and teachers, which are stored and can be read within Canvas. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default a user is automatically notifiied of new messages by e-mail, but this can also be changes in the nofication settings.
