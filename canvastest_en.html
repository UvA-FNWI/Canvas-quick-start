                    Modules provide structure to the course, grouping material e.g. thematically or chonologically.
                    They can contain various types of content:
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>

                        <td>Pages containing text, files or other materials</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Files</td>
                        <td>Any type of file uploaded in Canvas</td>

                        <td>Links to pages outside the course</td>

                    Within a module there is no room for explanations; pages can be used for this, 
                    where you can also easily refer to other content.

                <p>
                    Everything that has a grade or deadline (including an exam) is an <em>Assignment</em> in Canvas.
                    These can offer online submission or take the form of a <em>Quiz</em>.
                    Assignments can also be linked to <em>Rubrics</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <em>Grades</em> option allows you to register and publish grades.
                    Digital assignments can be graded and commented on in the <em>SpeedGrader</em>.

                    Most navigation options are hidden for students by default;
                    their contents can be made available via modules or pages.
                    Navigation options can be turned on in <em>Settings</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <em>Course manual</em> option is automatically added when the course manual is published in DataNose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <em>People</em> you find the enrolled students and teachers.
                    The groups have been imported from DataNose as <em>Sections</em>.
                    Here you can also create <em>Groups</em> for student collaboration.

                    option at three distinct levels: content items, modules and the course as a whole.
                    Content can only be found when all 3 levels are set to published.
